# BFS-And-DFS
This repository contains the implementations of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal algorithms for graph data structures in C++. These algorithms are fundamental to graph theory and are widely used in various applications such as pathfinding, scheduling, and connectivity analysis.
